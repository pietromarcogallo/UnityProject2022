# "Stardust Stroopers": Test your sharpness in space

This is a space-ambiented serious game proposing different variants of the Stroop tests presented to the audience in the form of fun and interactive minigames. This game is addressed mainly to ADHD-diagnosed children as main publicum, as a correlation between ADHD and reading disorders has been scientifically documented [1], hence making the results of the classical visual Stroop tests biased for that spectrum of patients.
Further details on the reasons behind the aforementioned choice of audience and to develop a serious game for this purpose can be found in the PowerPoint with the game presentation. Additionally, a high-level detailed description of the game dynamics can be found in the Game Design Document PDF, whereas the technical one code-wise is provided by the various C# scripts.
